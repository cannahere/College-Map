      <!-- Introduction Section -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <p>When you're just starting your college search, the biggest challenge is seeing the full picture. Traditional search methods force you to look for schools one at a time, by name, or through narrow filters that hide most of your options. You end up missing colleges simply because you didn't know to search for them.</p>
        
        <p>Visual Exploration changes that completely. Every U.S. college appears on one clear, interactive map. You can filter by type, ranking, region, or state to see exactly what you're looking for—or explore everything at once to discover schools you never knew existed.</p>

      <!-- Why This Matters -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Why visual exploration matters</h2>
        <p>Geography reveals patterns you can't see in lists. You might discover that certain regions have more schools in your preferred type, or that rankings don't always match what feels right for you. Visual exploration lets you see the full landscape before narrowing down—so you make informed decisions instead of guessing.</p>
