        <p>Planning a college visit trip shouldn't mean manually searching for schools along your route, one by one, and then building a route in Google Maps step by step. Route Planning turns that entire process into one seamless flow.</p>
        
        <p>Enter your starting point and destination, and the map instantly shows every college along your drive. You can filter those colleges to match what you care about, select the ones you want to visit, and then send the entire sequence to Google Maps as a ready-to-go driving route—no more manual typing or missed stops.</p>
